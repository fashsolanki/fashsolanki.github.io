Success is achieving what you are working your ass off for.

Some say that success is being happy, its getting up in the morning with a smile on your face. Well I dont think it is that way, being happy is a state of mind, one gets happy for various reasons but well I wont call that as success.

For a farmer success can be getting a better yield, meanwhile for a shy person it can be to surmount his shyness. All this requires them to work, and work until the target is achieved. **Success is achievements**.

We seek various things in various phases of life, be it getting good grades in exams, building a fu*king awesome product or making big strides in productivity. We try to achieve something, always. If you do achieve it then it's a success, else it's a failure.

Right now for me success is making hospitality better, through [Room n House](http://roomnhouse.com), we endeavor to make our customers happy. And I feel we are successful in achieving it.

Now get your lazy bum off and start achieving things you aspire for.
